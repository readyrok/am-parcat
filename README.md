# Am Parcat ca un Sef

"Am parcat ca un sef" is an app for people who are frustrated with the way parking works in the city and they decided it was time to show off with their impressive parking skills. On backend we used Spring Boot framework, for data persistance we used JPA and a PostgreSQL database, for authorization and authentication we used Spring Security and JWT and on frontend we used React with Jotai for state management and Axios for fetching APIs.
